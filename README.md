Globe Trotter
    A Sinatra app to help people keep track of their globe trotting adventures.

About
    As an avid travel, I've always wanted an easy and efficient place to store all the palces I've been to, included with some information of where I've been and what I did. This app, easily allows a user to keep track of all their trips, add new trips, edit existing trips and delete any they'd like to forget about. Hope you enjoy it.

Using Globe Trotter
    Once all installation steps are complete, you should be able to sign-up for a new account. Once signed in, you'll be able to start adding new trips, with a location, a description of your trip and the adventures that you experienced. After you've completed the new entry form, you can save  your trip and it will populate in a section with all your trips. You also have the ability to view other trips that other users have entered or edit/delete any trips you've entered. Enjoy!!!
